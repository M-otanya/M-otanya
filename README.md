About Me

Hi there! I'm Dennis, an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with a solid foundation in backend development using Java and Spring Boot. My focus is on building scalable, efficient, and cloud-optimized applications that leverage modern frameworks and cloud services.

Backend Development Skills

Java: Proficient in developing robust, high-performance backend systems using Java. Experienced in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns.
Spring Boot: Expertise in building RESTful APIs, microservices, and enterprise-grade backend systems using Spring Boot. I specialize in creating lightweight, scalable, and easily maintainable applications with advanced features like Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and more.
Database Integration: Skilled in working with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Strong understanding of database schema design, query optimization, and transaction management.
API Development: Expertise in developing secure, efficient, and well-documented REST APIs. Familiar with API versioning, rate limiting, and pagination strategies.

#Cloud Practitioner Expertise
As an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, I ensure that my backend solutions are designed with cloud scalability, cost-efficiency, and security in mind. Hereâ€™s how I integrate cloud services into my backend projects:

AWS Lambda: Leveraging AWS Lambda for serverless backend services and event-driven architectures.
Amazon RDS: Using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for high availability and auto-scaling databases.
Amazon S3: Efficient storage and retrieval of data using S3, with lifecycle policies and encryption for security.
Amazon API Gateway: Building scalable, secure APIs with API Gateway, integrated with AWS Lambda and backend microservices.
AWS Security: Applying best practices for IAM, encryption, and monitoring with services like AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail.
